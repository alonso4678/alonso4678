# Hi! I'm Alonso Riquelme

## **Teacher and web sites Developer**

Hi, I'm a teacher, and this last time I'm developing a website for my school, **Liceo Nibaldo Sepúlveda Fernández.** I've been using **node.js, markdown, git and github** for a while now and I find that it's an excellent development tool. I hope to learn how to use it well and get the most out of it.  Finally, I would like to mention that for me it is very interesting to work in the educational field.

In the following image we can see the school where I work.
